# REST Project in Java
## _SharingItemsPlatform_

The aim of the REST project is to provide a group of people (community) with a web page that
would allow them to post a set of media items they own such as: 
- books
- video games
- DVDs
- music CDs

The idea is that the owner can post comments on its items and so do the other users of
the website. This is used as a recommendation page. People before buying or reading a
book for instance, can first read the comments and why not ask if the user could land it to
them or sell it.
